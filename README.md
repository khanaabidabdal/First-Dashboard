# First-Dashboard

The following project is my first excel dashboard and internship project which was created by me to analyse the insights of sales data provided by the MeriSkill Information Service to take out some useful data and present them into the interactive dashboard.

For this project I learned to create the pivot tables in Excel and How to do data analysis of the data. The Dashboard contains following insights in form of interactive pivot tables with two slicers namely, product and city.

1) Revenue By Month
2) Top 5 Best Selling Products
3) Top 5 Poor Selling Products
4) Revenue Trends By Hours
5) Top Sale Areas
6) Product Price
